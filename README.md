# Upside x Down

## Description

Upside Down is an eCommerce website for our clothing brand that promotes the awareness of suicide and depression prevention, a portion of all sales will go to foundations related to the cause. We have been working on this idea off and on for the last couple years but have been road blocked by not having a website. The site is not done yet but we have a good majority done so far. In the future we are planning to have each item with it's own page instead of just one page with all the items, we also want to add in categories to help with organization and make space for more clothing pieces in the future and we also want to expand the accepted payment methods in the future for things like paypal and google P A Y or apple pay.
